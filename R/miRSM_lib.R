#' miRSM: Inferring miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data and miRNA-target binding information
#'
#' The package aims to identify miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data and miRNA-target binding information.
#' It provides several functions to study miRNA sponge modules, including popular methods for inferring gene modules 
#' (candidate miRNA sponge modules), and a function to identify miRNA sponge modules, as well as several functions to conduct 
#' modular analysis of miRNA sponge modules.
